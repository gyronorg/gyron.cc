## Conditional Rendering  

Conditional rendering is the same as if-else in JavaScript. You can create different components for different UI displays based on state.

### Basic Example

For example, we can display different components based on the user's login status.

```jsx
import { FC } from 'gyron'

const Guest = FC(() => {
  return <div>Please sign up</div> 
})

const User = FC(() => {
  return <div>Welcome</div>
})

const Home = FC(({ isLogin }) => {
  return isLogin ? <User /> : <Guest />
})
```

In the code above, there is a passed in `isLogin` variable. When it is [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy), the Welcome text will be displayed, otherwise Please sign up will be displayed.

### Logical AND Operator (&&) 

The `&&` operator is also an important feature in components, such as triggering an alarm when the CPU is greater than a threshold.

```jsx
const CpuAlert = () => {
  return <div>Warning: cpu usage exceeds 90%</div>
}

const App = ({ cpuUsed }) => {
  return cpuUsed > 0.9 && <CpuAlert /> 
}
```

When cpu is greater than 90%, Warning: cpu usage exceeds 90% will be displayed. If less than 90%, nothing will be displayed on the page, and a comment node will occupy the position in the DOM. (You can see `<!-->` by opening the console)
