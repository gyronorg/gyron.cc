## Core

The author of Gyron.js has developed some tools to help developers build front-end environments, such as common route managers and global state managers. If you want to adapt some community resources to Gyron.js, please contact us for help.

### Router

Router is a JavaScript library that helps users build interfaces and has powerful APIs. It is small yet fully functional, allows different ways to declare routes, and works on different rendering platforms (CSR/SSR).

```jsx
import { FC } from 'gyron'

import { Router, Route, Routes } from '@gyron/router'  

const App = FC(() => {
  return (
    <Router router={/* router */}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="" strict element={<div>Home</div>}></Route>
        <Route path="about" element={<div>About</div>}></Route>
      </Routes> 
    </Router>
  )
})
```

### Redux

Redux is a Gyron.js state management library based on Redux that incorporates all the functionality of Redux and is reactive. [https://redux.js.org/](https://redux.js.org/)

If you don't want such complex functionality, you can use `useReactive` to simulate a small state library without features like predictability and Devtool, but it also has reactivity.

```js
import { useReactive } from 'gyron'

export const storeState = useReactive({
  user: {},
  order: {}, 
})
```
