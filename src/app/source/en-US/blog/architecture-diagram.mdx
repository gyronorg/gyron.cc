## System Architecture Diagram

The upstream and downstream of `Gyron.js` has begun to take shape. On top of this, we have developed some applications, such as collaborative editors, documents supporting `SSR (Server Side Rendering)`, `SSG (Static Site Generator)` modes, and a component library based on `material design`. We believe there is much more Gyron.js can do and we look forward to everyone's utilization.
