## Hello World

This page shows how to use Gyron.js JSX syntax to create a Hello World node, and the final content of the node.

```jsx
const App = <h1>Hello World</h1>

// ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓ 

import { jsx } from '@gyron/jsx-runtime'

const App = jsx('h1', {
  children: 'Hello World', 
})
```

The above conversion process relies on capabilities of other platforms like babel. Here [JSX](/en-US/core/jsx/getting-started) you can see specifics of the code transformation.

Extended Reading:

- The code involves generating HMR auxiliary code during conversion using `babel-plugin-jsx`. If you are interested, you can go to [babel-plugin-jsx](/en-US/core/jsx/getting-started#babel-plugin-jsx) to learn more.

- JSX syntax can also be used without the babel-plugin-jsx plugin. See [https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react#react-automatic-runtime) for details.
