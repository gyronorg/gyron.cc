### CDN

There are some free CDN service providers in the community. Here are some commonly used ones.

### NPM

This way of referencing is recommended. It can easily use community resources and support more different browser versions.

```bash
npm install gyron -D
```

### Use After Download

Although you can download and then use our framework, it is not recommended, because some bugs may not get fixed in time.

After downloading through the CDN service, save it as gyron.js, then import it via the script tag.

```html
<div id="root"></div>

<script type="module">
  import { createInstance, h } from './gyron.js'

  createInstance(h('button', 'Like')).render('#root')
</script>
```
