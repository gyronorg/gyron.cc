## Asynchronous Components

Sometimes our components only render after certain actions complete. Especially during SSR rendering with pre-rendering based on user data, and code splitting with modern bundlers, asynchronous components can play an important role.

### FCA 

FCA is the built-in asynchronous component wrapper, enabling async syntax internally via the FCA function, e.g.:

```jsx
import { FCA } from 'gyron'

const App = FCA(() => {
  return getUserInfo().then((data) => <div>{data.name}</div>) 
})
```

The App function is an async component that displays user info after getUserInfo fetches it. 

Another example:

```jsx filename=index.jsx
const App = FCA(() => {
  return import('./dashboard').then(({ Dashboard }) => <Dashboard />)
})
```

```jsx filename=dashboard.jsx
import { FC } from 'gyron'

export const Dashboard = FC(() => {
  return <div>Dashboard</div> 
})
```

The App component in index.jsx is async, responsible for async import of the component in dashboard.jsx.

Then split dashboard.jsx file content using e.g. webpack's `optimization.splitChunks` or esbuild's `splitting` attribute in final entry file.

### fallback

Async components have a `fallback` param rendered before async complete, mainly as a placeholder to indicate loading data or resources.

```jsx
import { createInstance, App } from './index'

createInstance(<App fallback={<span>loading...</span>} />)
```
